# This configuration generates a scatter plot of the median wallclock time of
# the database ping time. The median is calculated using a 1-day aggregation
# window. Ping time is measured by sending a simple "SELECT 1" query and
# measuring the time it takes to get a response. It is useful for monitoring
# network latency and possible congestion in the database.
